# Part 1: curl_command="curl -s -H \"Authorization: token $TOKEN\" https://api.github.com/users/$USERNAME/repos?type=all&per_page=1000"
# Use curl to send a GET request to the GitHub API.
# The "-s" option silences curl's progress output.
# The "-H" option specifies a request header, the Authorization header with your GitHub Personal Access Token ($TOKEN)
# The URL retrieves all repositories ("repos") for a given user ($USERNAME), up to a maximum of 1000 repositories per page.
# The output of this command will be a JSON response containing details about each repository.

# Part 2: grep_command="grep -Eo '\"full_name\": \"[^\"]+\"'"
# Pipe (|) sends the output of the previous command to grep.
# grep filters the output.
# The "-Eo" option tells grep to only show the part of a line matching the pattern and to interpret the pattern as an extended regular expression.
# The pattern '"full_name": "[^"]+"' matches the full name of each repository, including the username and repo name.

# Part 3: awk_command="awk '{print $2}'"
# The output of grep is sent to awk.
# awk manipulates structured data.
# The '{print $2}' script tells awk to print the second field of each line, which is the full name of the repository in this case.

# Part 4: tr_command="tr -d '\"'"
# The output of awk is sent to tr.
# tr translates or deletes characters.
# The '-d' option tells tr to delete each input character in its argument (in this case, the quotation mark character), removing quotes from the repo names.

# Combine all the commands/parts to get the list of repository names.
# repos=$($curl_command | $grep_command | $awk_command | $tr_command)
